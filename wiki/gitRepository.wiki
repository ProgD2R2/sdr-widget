On Cygwin, search for "git" packages in setup.exe and install them. On a Linux system with apt run "apt-get install xxx". For both, with the command line you can follow these steps to get started:

  * cd github
  * git clone git://github.com/amontefusco/sdr-widget.git
  * cd sdr-widget
  * git checkout sdr-widget-2 (Change branch)
  * git branch sdr-widget-2-local (Create local branch)
  * git checkout sdr-widget-2-local (Switch to local branch)
  * At this stage you can import github/sdr-widget into AVR32studio
  * ...
The latest from Roger:

  * clone the github repository
    git clone git://github.com/amontefusco/sdr-widget.git
  * change directory into the clone, so git knows what you're talking about
    cd sdr-widget
  * tell git to grab all the branches and tags
    git fetch origin
  * checkout the sdr-widget-2 branch
    git checkout sdr-widget-2
  * set an environment variable to locate your avr32-gcc
    export AVR32BIN=where-ever-it-is
  * make Release/widget.elf and ./widget-control
    make

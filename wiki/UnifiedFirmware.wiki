#summary Unified Firmware works for various OSes and hardware.

= Introduction =

This is from Alex's mail on March 30. 

With great contributions from a various developers, including Roger,
Andrea, Loftur etc., the Unified firmware is now working quite well,
and I encourage all widget users to start flashing the Unified
firmware instead of the earlier individual firmware versions.

The source code of the Unified firmware is in a git repository. See 

git://github.com/amontefusco/sdr-widget.git

There are two main branches that has active development:

sdr-widget-2           for sdr-widget
sdr-widget-2-dib      for audio-widget        (also works for sdr-
widget.  just additional features for audio-widget boards)

I will upload .hex files built from the above two branches to the code
page periodically.  The latest .hex files are called:

widget.hex             built from sdr-widget-2
audio-widget.hex    built from sdr-widget-2-dib



= Details =

After flashing the firmware, you need to use the WidgetControl.py GUI
tool to setup the feature selections.  The GUI tool works under both
Windows and Linux, but you will have to install python26, pyusb,
pythoncard and wxpython (all available from public download.  Use
Google to find them).  The default feature set is for sdr-widget
board, UAC1 audio, normal IQ orientations, AK5394A and CS4344 chips.
This will work in all Operating Systems including Windows.

Note:  if you are running under Windows do NOT select UAC2 features,
as Windows does not support UAC2.

The equivalent of demo_UAC1_x_v087_WinXP is the uac1_dg8saq image.
